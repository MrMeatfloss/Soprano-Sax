Although the soprano sax is grouped as a widespreaded saxophone, it is definitely the least popular saxophone within the group, as well as holding the title for being the most uniquely designed saxophone.

As seen from the image above, the soprano sax (gold) on the left is compared to the clarinet (black) on the right. This image clearly showcases the difference in design for the soprano sax as compared to it's counterparts, where it's purpose is to be a lightweighted version of the saxophone family. Although the two may look similar, they play very differently as they have different roles in the parts they play. For example, the bass clarinet, which looks like it came from the saxophone family, plays a different role as compared to the tenor sax.
